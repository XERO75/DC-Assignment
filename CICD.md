# CI/CD Configuration Guide

## ðŸš€ GitHub Actions Workflow

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).

## ðŸ“‹ Workflow Steps

### 1. Test Stage
- **Trigger**: Every push to main/develop branches or PR creation
- **Actions**:
  - Code quality checks (ESLint)
  - Run unit tests
  - Generate test coverage report
  - Upload coverage to Codecov

### 2. Build Stage
- **Trigger**: After tests pass
- **Actions**:
  - Install dependencies
  - Build production version
  - Upload build artifacts

### 3. Deploy Stage
- **Trigger**: Only on main branch, after tests and build pass
- **Actions**:
  - Automatic deployment to Vercel production

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Requirements

### GitHub Secrets Setup

Add the following secrets in your GitHub repository settings:

```bash
VERCEL_TOKEN=your_vercel_token
ORG_ID=your_vercel_org_id
PROJECT_ID=your_vercel_project_id
```

### Getting Vercel Configuration

1. **Get Vercel Token**:
   ```bash
   # Install Vercel CLI
   npm i -g vercel
   
   # Login and get token
   vercel login
   ```

2. **Get Org ID and Project ID**:
   ```bash
   # Run in project root directory
   vercel link
   
   # Check .vercel/project.json file
   cat .vercel/project.json
   ```

## ðŸ“Š Workflow Status

The workflow includes the following checks:

- âœ… **Code Quality**: ESLint checks
- âœ… **Test Coverage**: 17 test cases
- âœ… **Build Verification**: Production build testing
- âœ… **Auto Deployment**: Vercel production deployment

## ðŸŽ¯ Optimization Recommendations

### Performance Optimization
- Use Node.js caching to speed up builds
- Parallel execution of test and build tasks
- Conditional deployment (main branch only)

### Security Optimization
- Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive information
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular updates of Actions versions

## ðŸ“ˆ Monitoring and Reporting

### Test Coverage
- Automatic coverage report generation
- Upload to Codecov platform
- Coverage threshold: 30%

### Deployment Status
- Vercel deployment status notifications
- Build logs and error reports
- Performance monitoring integration

## ðŸ”„ Workflow File

Configuration file location: `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`

Key features:
- Multi-environment support (test, build, deploy)
- Conditional triggers and dependency management
- Error handling and rollback mechanisms
- Notification and reporting integration
